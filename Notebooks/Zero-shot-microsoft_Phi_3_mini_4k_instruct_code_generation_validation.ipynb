policy, role, and level. We also create an ingress and egress level and bind them to the default role. Then we create a default service perimeter and bind it to the ingress and egress levels. Finally, we create an IAM binding for the service perimeter and bind it to the default role and service account.\\n\\nTo use this configuration, you need to define variables in a `variables.tf` file:\\n\\n```hcl\\nvariable \\\"project_id\\\" {\\n  description = \\\"The ID of the project\\\"\\n  type        = string\\n}\\n\\nvariable \\\"region\\\" {\\n  description = \\\"The region to deploy the resources\\\"\\n  type        = string\\n}\\n\\nvariable \\\"user_email\\\" {\\n  description = \\\"The email of the user to grant access to\\\"\\n  type        = string\\n}\\n\\nvariable \\\"service_account_email\\\" {\\n  description = \\\"The email of the service account to bind to the roles and perimeters\\\"\\n  type        = string\\n}\\n```\\n\\nYou can then use this configuration by creating a `main.tf` file and importing the variables:\\n\\n```hcl\\nprovider \\\"google\\\" {\\n  project = var.project_id\\n  region  = var.region\\n}\\n\\nterraform {\\n  required_providers {\\n    google = {\\n      source  = \\\"hashicorp/google\\\"\\n      version = \\\"~> 3.0\\\"\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nmodule \\\"access_policy\\\" {\\n  source = \\\"./modules/access_policy\\\"\\n\\n  user_email = var.user_email\\n  service_account_email = var.service_account_email\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis configuration uses the `modules/access_policy` module to create the access policy, role, levels, service perimeter, and IAM binding. The module accepts two variables: `user_email` and `service_account_email`.\\n\\nTo run this configuration, run the following commands:\\n\\n```\\nterraform init\\nterraform plan\\nterraform apply\\n```\",\n          \"Resource 'google_project_iam_binding' {\\n  count = \\\"${length(var.roles)}\\\"\\n  name  = \\\"${var.project_id}-${count.index}\\\"\\n\\n  role = \\\"${element(var.roles, count.index)}\\\"\\n  members = \\\"${element(var.service_account_email, count.index)}\\\"\\n}\\n\\noutput \\\"project_id\\\" {\\n  value = \\\"${var.project_id}\\\"\\n}\\n\\noutput \\\"service_account_key\\\" {\\n  value = \\\"${google_service_account_iam_member.service_account.email_private_key_file}\\\"\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"google_project\\\" \\\"my_project\\\" {\\n  project_id = \\\"${var.project_id}\\\"\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"google_project_service\\\" \\\"api_services\\\" {\\n  for_each = toset(var.enabled_apis)\\n  project  = \\\"${google_project.my_project.project_id}\\\"\\n  service  = \\\"${each.key}\\\"\\n  name     = \\\"${each.key}\\\"\\n  disable_dependent_services = true\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"google_service_account\\\" \\\"my_service_account\\\" {\\n  account_id = \\\"${var.service_account_email}\\\"\\n  display_name = \\\"${var.service_account_display_name}\\\"\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"google_service_account_iam_member\\\" \\\"service_account\\\" {\\n  service_account_id = \\\"${google_service_account.my_service_account.email}\\\"\\n  role               = \\\"roles/owner\\\"\\n  member             = \\\"${google_project.my_project.name}\\\"\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"google_project_iam_binding\\\" \\\"service_account_binding\\\" {\\n  role = \\\"roles/owner\\\"\\n  members = [\\n    \\\"${google_service_account.my_service_account.email}\\\"\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nvariable \\\"project_id\\\" {\\n  type = \\\"string\\\"\\n}\\n\\nvariable \\\"enabled_apis\\\" {\\n  type = \\\"list\\\"\\n  default = [\\\"pubsub.googleapis.com\\\", \\\"cloudbuild.googleapis.com\\\"]\\n}\\n\\nvariable \\\"service_account_email\\\" {\\n  type = \\\"string\\\"\\n}\\n\\nvariable \\\"service_account_display_name\\\" {\\n  type = \\\"string\\\"\\n}\\n\\nvariable \\\"roles\\\" {\\n  type = \\\"list\\\"\\n  default = [\\\"roles/owner\\\", \\\"roles/editor\\\", \\\"roles/viewer\\\"]\\n}\\n\\noutput \\\"project_id\\\" {\\n  description = \\\"The ID of the created Google Cloud project.\\\"\\n  value       = \\\"${google_project.my_project.project_id}\\\"\\n}\\n\\noutput \\\"service_account_key\\\" {\\n  description = \\\"The private key file of the created service account.\\\"\\n  value       = \\\"${google_service_account.my_service_account.private_key_file}\\\"\\n}\",\n          \"# AWS EC2 Instance Module\\n\\n```hcl\\nvariable \\\"instance_name\\\" {\\n  description = \\\"Name of the EC2 instance\\\"\\n  type        = string\\n}\\n\\nvariable \\\"ami_id\\\" {\\n  description = \\\"AMI ID for the EC2 instance\\\"\\n  type        = string\\n}\\n\\nvariable \\\"instance_type\\\" {\\n  description = \\\"Instance type for the EC2 instance\\\"\\n  type        = string\\n  default     = \\\"t2.micro\\\"\\n}\\n\\nvariable \\\"region\\\" {\\n  description = \\\"Region for the EC2 instance\\\"\\n  type        = string\\n  default     = \\\"us-west-2\\\"\\n}\\n\\nvariable \\\"key_name\\\" {\\n  description = \\\"Key pair name for the EC2 instance\\\"\\n  type        = string\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"aws_security_group\\\" \\\"default\\\" {\\n  name        = \\\"${var.instance_name}-sg\\\"\\n  description = \\\"Default security group for ${var.instance_name}\\\"\\n\\n  ingress {\\n    from_port   = 22\\n    to_port     = 22\\n    protocol    = \\\"tcp\\\"\\n    cidr_blocks = [\\\"0.0.0.0/0\\\"]\\n  }\\n\\n  egress {\\n    from_port   = 0\\n    to_port     = 0\\n    protocol    = \\\"-1\\\"\\n    cidr_blocks = [\\\"0.0.0.0/0\\\"]\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nresource \\\"aws_instance\\\" \\\"default\\\" {\\n  ami           = var.ami_id\\n  instance_type = var.instance_type\\n  key_name      = var.key_name\\n  security_groups = [aws_security_group.default.name]\\n\\n  tags = {\\n    Name = var.instance_name\\n  }\\n}\\n\\noutput \\\"instance_id\\\" {\\n  value = aws_instance.default.id\\n}\\n\\noutput \\\"public_ip\\\" {\\n  value = aws_instance.default.public_ip\\n}\\n```\\n\\n# Usage Example\\n\\n```hcl\\nprovider \\\"aws\\\" {\\n  region = \\\"us-west-2\\\"\\n}\\n\\nmodule \\\"ec2_instance\\\" {\\n  source = \\\"./modules/aws_ec2_instance\\\"\\n\\n  instance_name = \\\"my-instance\\\"\\n  ami_id        = \\\"ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0\\\"\\n  key_name      = \\\"my-key-pair\\\"\\n}\\n\\noutput \\\"instance_id\\\" {\\n  value = module.ec2_instance.instance_id\\n}\\n\\noutput \\\"public_ip\\\" {\\n  value = module.ec2_instance.public_ip\\n}\\n```\\n\\n*Note: This configuration assumes that the user has an existing key pair named \\\"my-key-pair\\\" and an AMI ID \\\"ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0\\\" in the us-west-2 region.

    "1. Security Vulnerabilities\n",
    "                •              Focus: Look for hard-coded credentials, improper access controls, and insecure resource configurations that could expose the infrastructure to security risks.\n",
    "2. Incorrect Resource Configuration\n",

    "6. Resource Deletion or Replacement\n",
    "                •              Focus: Review the code for any inadvertent deletion or replacement of critical resources, which could lead to data loss or significant downtime.\n",

      "2. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not correctly associate the route table with the subnet. The Golden Terraform code includes an `aws_route_table_association` resource to associate the route table with the subnet, which is missing in the generated code.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not use the `var.vpc_id` variable for the VPC ID in the `aws_subnet`, `aws_security_group`, and `aws_route_table` resources, which is required to ensure the resources are created within the specified VPC.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules incorrectly. The `module \"vpc\"`, `module \"route_table\"`, and `module \"security_group\"` all source from `./modules/vpc`, which is not modular and does not align with the Golden Terraform code structure. Each module should have its own source directory and specific input/output variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not correctly configure the security group to allow access within the availability zone as specified in the Golden Terraform code. The Golden Terraform code configures the security group to allow all traffic within the subnet's CIDR block, while the generated code allows HTTP and HTTPS traffic from any IP address, which is not aligned with the user query.\n",
      "\n",

      "In summary, the generated Terraform code does not meet the user’s requirements as described in the query and does not align with the Golden Terraform code. It has several issues related to incorrect resource configuration, logical errors, misuse of modules, networking configuration issues, and completeness.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query and the Golden Terraform code requirements. Here are the specific issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not explicitly define the security group rules, particularly the ingress rules that allow open access within the availability zone. This could lead to improper access controls.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not derive the subnet's CIDR block from the VPC's CIDR block as specified in the user query and Golden Terraform code. Instead, it takes `subnet_cidr` as a variable, which is not aligned with the requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules for VPC, subnet, security group, and route table, but it does not provide the actual implementation of these modules. Without seeing the module code, it's impossible to verify if they meet the requirements.\n",
      "   - The Golden Terraform code uses `cidrsubnet` to derive the subnet's CIDR block, which is missing in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not show how the modules handle idempotency. The Golden Terraform code ensures idempotency by using data sources and derived values.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - There are no apparent syntax errors in the generated code, but the lack of implementation details in the modules makes it incomplete.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not provide enough detail to assess whether it might inadvertently delete or replace critical resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify Terraform or provider versions, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules but does not provide their definitions. This makes it difficult to verify if the modules are used correctly and if they meet the requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure that the subnet's CIDR block is derived from the VPC's CIDR block, which is a critical networking configuration requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",
      "    - The generated code does not provide enough detail to evaluate performance and efficiency. The Golden Terraform code is more efficient as it uses data sources and derived values to ensure correct configurations.\n",

      "Reason: The generated Terraform code has several issues when compared to the user query and the Golden Terraform code. Here are the specific problems:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The `credentials` field in the provider block is hard-coded, which is a security risk. It should be managed through environment variables or a secure secrets manager.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The `google_compute_disk` resources for etcd events and main storage are not correctly configured. The Golden Terraform code specifies three disks in different zones, but the generated code uses a module that does not correctly handle the `count` parameter to create multiple disks.\n",
      "   - The `google_compute_disk` resource in the module does not have a `count` parameter, which is necessary to create multiple disks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The `zone` attribute in the provider block is unnecessary because the disks are spread across multiple zones.\n",
      "   - The `target_tags` attribute in the firewall rule is not mentioned in the user query or the Golden Terraform code. It should be removed unless explicitly required.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The use of modules without proper handling of the `count` parameter can lead to inconsistent results when applied multiple times.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - There are no syntax errors in the generated code.\n",

      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the required Terraform and provider versions, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The module for `etcd_disk` is not correctly implemented. It should handle the creation of multiple disks using the `count` parameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The networking configuration is mostly correct, but the unnecessary `target_tags` attribute in the firewall rule could lead to unintended behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",

      "This corrected code addresses the issues identified and aligns with the user query and the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "**Correct: No**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reason:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities:**\n",
      "   - The generated code has a potential security vulnerability by allowing SSH access from `0.0.0.0/0`, which opens SSH access to the entire internet. This is generally not recommended for production environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration:**\n",
      "   - The `region` attribute in the `google_compute_subnetwork` resources is incorrectly set to `google_compute_network.my_network.region`, which is not a valid attribute. It should be a variable or a hardcoded region value.\n",
      "   - The `ingress` and `egress` blocks in the `google_compute_firewall` resource for internal communication are incorrectly structured. The `rule` block is not a valid sub-block for `ingress` and `egress`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not use variables for the project ID, region, and CIDR ranges, making it less flexible and harder to reuse.\n",
      "   - The `private_ip_google_access` attribute is set to `true` for both subnets without any specific requirement from the user query.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code should be idempotent, but the incorrect resource configurations and logical errors could lead to unexpected behavior when applied multiple times.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors:**\n",
      "   - The `ingress` and `egress` blocks in the `google_compute_firewall` resource for internal communication contain syntax errors. The correct structure should be directly specifying the `allow` block within the `google_compute_firewall` resource.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement:**\n",
      "   - There are no apparent issues with resource deletion or replacement in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the required provider version, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not use modules, which is acceptable for small configurations but not ideal for larger, more complex infrastructures.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not fully address the internal communication requirements as specified in the user query. The internal communication firewall rule is incorrectly configured.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency:**\n",
      "    - The generated code is relatively simple and should perform efficiently, but the lack of variables and incorrect configurations reduce its overall effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user’s requirements and contains several issues related to security, incorrect resource configuration, logical errors, and syntax errors. It is recommended to revise the code to align with the Golden Terraform code and best practices.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query and Golden Terraform code requirements. Here are the specific issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include an ingress rule for HTTP (port 80) in the security group, which is necessary for web server access.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses a hardcoded AMI (`ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0`) instead of using the `lookup(var.aws_amis, var.aws_region)` approach from the Golden Terraform code. This does not meet the user’s requirement of using specified AMIs and region settings.\n",
      "   - The `aws_security_group` resource in the generated code references `aws_vpc.main.id`, but there is no `aws_vpc` resource defined in the provided code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The `local_file` resource writes the public key to a file, but the `key_name` in the `aws_instance` resource should reference an existing key pair in AWS, not a local file path.\n",
      "   - The `module \"web_server\"` references `local.ssh_key.filename` for `key_name`, which is incorrect. It should reference an actual key pair name in AWS.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure idempotency for the SSH key pair creation. If the code is applied multiple times, it may create multiple key pairs, leading to inconsistencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - No syntax errors were found in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - No inadvertent deletion or replacement of critical resources was found.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - No version compatibility issues were found.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules for `web_server` and `elb`, but the module definitions are not provided in the user query or Golden Terraform code. This makes it difficult to verify if the modules are used correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the necessary networking configuration for the ELB, such as subnets and availability zones, which are critical for proper load balancer functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",
      "    - The generated code uses an `aws_ebs_volume` and `aws_volume_attachment` for the web server, which adds unnecessary complexity. The Golden Terraform code does not include this, indicating it is not required for the user’s query.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user’s requirements and has several issues related to security, resource configuration, logical errors, and networking configuration. The Golden Terraform code is more aligned with the user query and follows best practices more closely.\n",
      "**Correct: No**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reason:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities:**\n",
      "   - **Hard-coded Credentials:** The generated code includes a path to a service account JSON file (`credentials = file(\"path/to/your/service-account.json\")`). This is a potential security risk as it suggests storing sensitive credentials in the codebase. Best practice is to use environment variables or secret management services.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration:**\n",
      "   - **Monitoring and Logging Configuration:** The generated code does not fully implement the detailed monitoring, alerting, and logging configurations as specified in the Golden Terraform code. For example, it lacks the detailed alert policies and logging metrics for specific conditions like human access to secrets or Cloud Run breakglass events.\n",
      "   - **Notification Channels:** The generated code defines notification channels but does not fully implement the detailed configurations for paging and non-paging channels as seen in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors:**\n",
      "   - **Resource Dependencies:** The generated code does not include dependencies on the manual step to enable the workspace (`null_resource.manual-step-to-enable-workspace`), which is crucial for the correct setup of monitoring resources.\n",
      "   - **Uptime Checks:** The uptime checks in the generated code are not as detailed and specific as those in the Golden Terraform code. The Golden code includes specific paths and SSL validation, which are missing in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues:**\n",
      "   - **Resource Naming:** The generated code uses hard-coded names for resources like `exposure-notifications-server`, which could lead to conflicts if the code is applied multiple times or in different environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors:**\n",
      "   - **None detected.** The syntax appears correct, but the logical and functional issues are more critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement:**\n",
      "   - **None detected.** There is no indication of inadvertent deletion or replacement of critical resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues:**\n",
      "   - **None detected.** The generated code does not specify Terraform or provider versions, which could lead to compatibility issues. The Golden code specifies required versions for Terraform and providers.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules:**\n",
      "   - **Module Usage:** The generated code uses a module for the exposure notifications server but does not provide the same level of detail and configuration as the Golden code. The module should encapsulate all the necessary configurations for monitoring, alerting, and logging.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues:**\n",
      "   - **None detected.** The networking configuration appears minimal but correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency:**\n",
      "    - **Suboptimal Resource Usage:** The generated code does not leverage the detailed configurations and optimizations present in the Golden code, potentially leading to less efficient monitoring and alerting setups.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The generated Terraform code does not meet the user’s requirements as described in the query and does not align with the Golden Terraform code. It lacks detailed configurations for monitoring, alerting, and logging, and has potential security vulnerabilities due to hard-coded credentials. The code also misses critical dependencies and detailed alert policies, making it incomplete and not functionally equivalent to the Golden code.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not meet the user query requirements and the Golden Terraform code in several aspects. Here are the specific issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not explicitly set `uniform_bucket_level_access` to `true` for the storage bucket, which is a best practice for security.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not create a `google_storage_bucket_object` to store the client parameters in JSON format. This is a critical part of the user query and the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "   - The `client_params` in the generated code are not structured as required by the user query. The Golden Terraform code specifies a detailed structure for `client_params`, including `remote_ipv4_addresses`, `remote_ipv6_addresses`, `ca_cert_pem`, and `private_subnets`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The `bucket_name` in the `storage_bucket` module is incorrectly defined as `${module.storage_bucket.resource_name_prefix}-${var.customer_id}`. This should be `${var.resource_name_prefix}-${var.customer_id}-bucket` as per the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "   - The `client_params` in the `openvpn_client` module are not correctly structured. The Golden Terraform code specifies a more complex JSON structure for the client parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure that the bucket and its contents are managed idempotently. The Golden Terraform code uses `force_destroy = true` to ensure that the bucket and its contents are properly managed.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - There are no syntax errors in the generated code, but the logical and functional issues make it incorrect.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not handle the deletion of the bucket and its contents as specified in the Golden Terraform code (`force_destroy = true`).\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the required provider version, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules (`storage_bucket` and `openvpn_client`) without providing their actual implementation. This makes it impossible to verify if the modules meet the requirements.\n",

      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query and Golden Terraform code requirements based on the following criteria:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The generated code includes a hard-coded path to the service account credentials (`credentials = \"path/to/service-account.json\"`). This is a security risk as it exposes sensitive information. The Golden Terraform code does not include such hard-coded paths.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not use the same module structure as the Golden Terraform code. The Golden Terraform code uses two modules (`base_shared_gce_instance` and `peering_gce_instance`), while the generated code uses a single module (`compute_instance`). This indicates a potential misalignment with the intended design.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the `locals` block to define `business_unit` and `environment`, which are used in the Golden Terraform code. This could lead to logical errors in the configuration.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",

      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query and Golden Terraform code requirements for several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The `provider \"google\"` block hardcodes the project ID (`project = \"your-project-id\"`), which should be dynamically set using the `project_id` variable. This does not align with the Golden Terraform code where the project ID is managed through a variable.\n",
      "   - The `region` is hardcoded to \"us-central1\", which may not be appropriate for all use cases. It would be better to parameterize this value.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The `gcp_project` module is expected to manage the Google Cloud project creation, but there is no indication that it does so correctly. The Golden Terraform code does not include a separate module for project creation, implying that the project ID is already managed externally or through a different mechanism.\n",
      "   - The `cloud_run_service` module is used, but it is not clear if it aligns with the example module path (`../../../examples/cloudrun`) specified in the Golden Terraform code. The source path should be verified to ensure it points to the correct module.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Completeness**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include an output for the project ID, which is present in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "   - The output for the load balancer IP (`cloud_run_service_ip`) does not match the expected output name (`lb_ip`) in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The `project_id` variable is passed to the `cloud_run_service` module as `module.gcp_project.project_id`, but there is no guarantee that the `gcp_project` module outputs a `project_id`. This could lead to logical errors if the output is not correctly defined in the `gcp_project` module.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Best Practices**:\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The firewall rule allows traffic from `0.0.0.0/0`, which is not secure. It should be more restrictive based on the actual requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The `google_organization` resource is not a valid resource in Terraform. Organizations are not created or managed through Terraform; they are typically pre-existing.\n",
      "   - The `google_project` resource is missing the `org_id` attribute and should use `folder_id` if it is to be nested under a folder.\n",
      "   - The `google_folder` resource incorrectly references `google_project.my_project.folder_id`. It should reference the organization or another folder as its parent.\n",
      "   - The `google_compute_disk` resource is missing the `project` attribute to specify the project it belongs to.\n",
      "   - The `google_compute_firewall` resource references a non-existent `google_compute_network.my_network`. It should reference an actual network resource or the default network.\n",
      "   - The `google_storage_bucket` resource should use a unique name, possibly incorporating a random ID to avoid conflicts.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The `google_project_iam_policy` resource should be replaced with `google_project_iam_member` or `google_project_iam_binding` for more granular IAM control.\n",
      "   - The `google_folder` resource should have its `parent` attribute correctly set to the organization or another folder.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The `google_storage_bucket` name should be unique to avoid conflicts when the configuration is applied multiple times.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - There are no syntax errors, but logical and configuration issues need to be addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - No immediate issues, but incorrect configurations could lead to unintended resource deletions or replacements.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - The code does not specify the required provider version, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - No modules are used, but the code should be modularized for better maintainability.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",

      "   - The generated code does not handle the creation of schemas and their association with topics as specified in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the conditional logic to handle the creation of resources based on input variables, which is present in the Golden Terraform code.

      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include lifecycle rules for the S3 bucket, which could lead to inconsistent behavior when the configuration is applied multiple times.\n",

      "8. **Misuse of Modules:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not use any modules, which is acceptable but could be improved for modularity and reusability.\n",

The Golden Terraform code provided is more comprehensive and adheres to best practices.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query and the Golden Terraform code requirements. Here are the specific issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The user query specifies that the virtual network and subnet names, address space, and location should be parameterized. The generated code uses hard-coded values (`\"my-virtual-network\"`, `\"10.0.0.0/16\"`, `\"East US\"`, etc.) instead of variables.\n",
      "   - The Golden Terraform code uses variables for `vpc_cidr`, `subnet_cidr`, `name`, and `location`, which allows for more flexibility and reusability.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code creates a separate `azurerm_subnet` resource, whereas the Golden Terraform code defines the subnet within the `azurerm_virtual_network` resource. This is not necessarily incorrect but deviates from the structure provided in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Best Practices**:\n",
      "   - The Golden Terraform code uses data sources to retrieve the subnet ID, which is a good practice for ensuring that the subnet exists and is correctly referenced. The generated code does not use data sources and directly outputs the resource IDs.\n",
      "   - The Golden Terraform code uses interpolation syntax (`\"${var.name}\"`), which is more flexible and aligns with best practices for parameterization.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Completeness**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the necessary variables to parameterize the configuration, which makes it less flexible and harder to reuse for different environments or configurations.\n",

      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not meet the user query requirements and has several issues when compared to the Golden Terraform code. Here are the specific reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The generated code allows traffic from any source (`source_ranges = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"]`), which is a security risk. The Golden code restricts this to specific IP ranges for health checks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses `google_compute_target_https_proxy` instead of `google_compute_target_tcp_proxy`. The user query specifically asks for a TCP proxy load balancer, not an HTTPS proxy.\n",
      "   - The `google_compute_backend_service` in the generated code is missing the `health_checks` attribute configuration. It incorrectly uses `enable_health_checks` which is not a valid attribute.\n",
      "   - The `google_compute_backend_service` is missing the `log_config` and `dynamic \"backend\"` blocks which are present in the Golden code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the necessary IPv6 configuration. The Golden code conditionally creates IPv6 resources based on the `enable_ipv6_forwarding` variable.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the `google_compute_global_address` resources for both IPv4 and IPv6, which are necessary for the load balancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not use variables for project ID, network, and other configurations, which can lead to inconsistencies and difficulties in reusing the code across different environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - The `google_compute_backend_service` resource in the generated code has an incorrect configuration for health checks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - Not directly applicable, but the incorrect use of `google_compute_target_https_proxy` instead of `google_compute_target_tcp_proxy` could lead to unintended behavior and potential downtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the provider version, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not use modules correctly. The Golden code is modular and uses variables to make the code reusable and maintainable.\n",

      "**Correct: No**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reason:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities:**\n",
      "   - The generated code has security groups with overly permissive ingress rules (`0.0.0.0/0` for both SSH and HTTP). This exposes the EC2 instance to potential security risks. The Golden Terraform code restricts HTTP access to the VPC CIDR block, which is a more secure approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration:**\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules for VPC, Internet Gateway, Security Groups, ELB, and EC2 instance, but it does not configure the ELB listeners or the EC2 instance's software as specified in the user query and Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "   - The Golden Terraform code includes specific software installation steps for the EC2 instance, which are missing in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the necessary route table configuration to associate the Internet Gateway with the VPC, which is present in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the key pair for the EC2 instance correctly. It uses a hardcoded key name (`\"my-key-pair\"`) instead of a variable or resource reference.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code should be idempotent, but the lack of specific software installation steps and proper key pair configuration could lead to inconsistent results.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors:**\n",
      "   - There are no syntax errors in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement:**\n",
      "   - There are no inadvertent deletions or replacements of critical resources in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code should be compatible with the latest Terraform and AWS provider versions, but it does not specify the required versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules:**\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules correctly, but it does not fully utilize them to meet the user query requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not configure the route table to allow internet access through the Internet Gateway, which is a critical networking configuration issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency:**\n",
      "    - The generated code is efficient in terms of resource usage, but it lacks the necessary configurations to meet the user query requirements fully.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query requirements or match the Golden Terraform code.

The code needs to be revised to include proper security group rules, route table configurations, key pair references, and software installation steps for the EC2 instance.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason:\n",
      "1. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the necessary variables for `application_type` and `resource_type`, which are required to construct the names of the virtual network and subnet as specified in the user query and Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "   - The `azurerm_subnet` resource in the generated code uses `address_prefixes` instead of `address_prefix`, which is incorrect. The correct attribute is `address_prefix`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not concatenate `application_type` and `resource_type` to form the names of the virtual network and subnet. This is a key requirement from the user query and Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "   - The `resource_group` block in the generated code is incorrectly defined. It should be a `variable` block instead of a `resource` block.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Completeness**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the output block to output the subnet ID, which is present in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The module usage is not aligned with the user query and Golden Terraform code. The module should be designed to accept `application_type` and `resource_type` as inputs and use them to construct resource names.\n",

      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The security group allows ingress on port 443, which is not specified in the user query or Golden Terraform code. The Golden Terraform code allows all TCP and UDP traffic, which might be more appropriate for a Lattice cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses a single EC2 instance module with a fixed AMI and instance type (`t2.micro`). The user query and Golden Terraform code specify multiple EC2 instances with different instance types for the Lattice Coordinator and Cells.\n",
      "   - The AMI is hardcoded in the generated code, whereas the Golden Terraform code uses a variable to select the appropriate AMI based on the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The `internet_gateway` module is incorrectly configured. It should reference the VPC ID, not the internet gateway ID.\n",
      "   - The `route_tables` module is incorrectly configured. It should reference the VPC ID and public subnet IDs, not the internet gateway ID.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include any provisioners or scripts to set up the Lattice cluster, which are essential for the correct deployment and management of the cluster.\n",

      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - No syntax errors were found in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - No inadvertent deletion or replacement of critical resources was found.\n",
      "\n",

      "**Reason:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities:**\n",
      "   - **Hard-coded Credentials:** The generated code contains hard-coded database credentials (`db_password`), which is a security risk. These should be managed securely, for example, using Google Secret Manager or environment variables.\n",
      "\n",

      "3. **Logical Errors:**\n",
      "   - **Resource Dependencies:** The generated code does not include explicit dependencies between resources, which could lead to issues during the creation process. For example, the Pub/Sub subscription should depend on the Pub/Sub topic.\n",
      "   - **Module Usage:** The generated code uses modules for DNS records, Pub/Sub, and service accounts, but these modules are not defined in the provided code, leading to logical errors.\n",

      "5. **Syntax Errors:**\n",
      "   - **Service Account Roles:** The `google_service_account_iam_binding` resource in the `service_account_roles` module is incorrectly configured. The `members` attribute should be a list of strings, not a single string.\n",

      "1. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not explicitly define the IAM roles and permissions for GKE and Jenkins service accounts. Instead, it references external modules (`gke_iam` and `jenkins_iam`) that are not provided, making it impossible to verify if the correct roles and permissions are being set.\n",
      "   - The Golden Terraform code specifies the exact roles and permissions for GKE and Jenkins service accounts, which are missing in the generated code.\n",

      "   - The generated code uses modules without providing their implementation. This makes it unclear how the IAM roles and permissions are being configured, leading to potential logical errors in the infrastructure setup.\n",
      "   - The Golden Terraform code uses local variables to map service accounts and roles, ensuring that the correct roles are assigned to the correct service accounts. This mapping is missing in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Completeness**:\n",
      "   - The generated code is incomplete as it relies on external modules that are not defined within the provided code. The Golden Terraform code is self-contained and includes all necessary resources and configurations.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the specific IAM roles (`roles/compute.securityAdmin` for GKE and `roles/editor` for Jenkins) as specified in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Best Practices**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not follow best practices for defining IAM roles and permissions directly within the Terraform configuration. Instead, it offloads this responsibility to external modules without providing their implementation.\n",
      "   - The Golden Terraform code follows best practices by explicitly defining the IAM roles and permissions within the configuration, ensuring clarity and maintainability.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the provider versions, which could lead to compatibility issues. The Golden Terraform code specifies the provider versions (`google` and `google-beta`), ensuring compatibility and stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the generated Terraform code is not correct as it does not meet the user query and Golden Terraform code requirements. It lacks explicit IAM role and permission definitions, relies on undefined external modules, and does not follow best practices for completeness and clarity.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason:\n",
      "1. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated Terraform code is focused on creating IAM roles and attaching policies to those roles, whereas the user query and the Golden Terraform code are focused on managing IAM groups, policies, and user memberships.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code assumes roles for services like `ec2.amazonaws.com`, which is not aligned with the user query that specifies roles for different user groups (admins, developers, etc.).\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses a module for IAM roles, but the user query and Golden Terraform code do not indicate the need for such a module. Instead, the focus should be on IAM groups and policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Completeness**:\n",
      "   - The generated code is incomplete as it does not cover all the necessary resources and configurations required by the user query. Specifically, it lacks the creation of IAM groups, group policies, and group memberships.\n",

      "5. **Best Practices**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not follow the best practices for managing IAM groups and policies as outlined in the Golden Terraform code. The Golden Terraform code uses variables and resource dependencies to ensure proper configuration and management of IAM groups and policies.\n",

      "   - The generated code uses modules, but it does not provide the definitions for these modules, making it difficult to verify if they are used correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",

      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses `aws_eip` to allocate Elastic IPs for each instance, which is not mentioned in the user query or the Golden Terraform code. This could lead to additional costs and is not aligned with the requirements.\n",
      "   - The `user_data` parameter in the generated code uses `file(\"${path.module}/${var.cloud_init_script}\")`, which assumes the cloud-init script is a file in the module directory. The Golden Terraform code uses a `template_file` data source to render the cloud-init script, which is more flexible and allows for variable substitution.\n",

      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The `aws_eip` resource is not necessary as the user query does not mention the need for Elastic IPs. The Golden Terraform code does not include this resource either.\n",
      "   - The output `instance_dns_names` in the generated code is incorrect. The `aws_eip` resource does not have a `public_dns` attribute. The correct attribute should be `aws_instance.web_server[*].public_dns`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code should produce consistent results when applied multiple times, but the unnecessary inclusion of `aws_eip` resources could lead to unintended infrastructure changes and additional costs.\n",

      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not use modules, whereas the Golden Terraform code uses a `template_file` data source to manage the cloud-init script. This makes the Golden Terraform code more modular and maintainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the subnet ID for the instances, which is a critical networking configuration. The Golden Terraform code includes a `subnet_id` variable to ensure instances are placed in the correct subnet.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",

      "\n",
      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query and the Golden Terraform code requirements. Here are the specific issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules for VPC and subnets, which is a good practice, but it does not create distinct subnets for database and DMZ purposes across two availability zones as specified in the user query.\n",
      "   - The Golden Terraform code specifies subnets in two different availability zones (`a` and `c`), while the generated code only uses `us-west-2a` and `us-west-2b`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not create separate subnets for database and DMZ in each availability zone. Instead, it creates one database subnet in `us-west-2a` and one DMZ subnet in `us-west-2b`.\n",
      "   - The Golden Terraform code creates four subnets: `db_a`, `db_c`, `dmz_a`, and `dmz_c`, each associated with different route tables. The generated code only creates two subnets and associates them with a single route table.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Completeness**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include all necessary resources and configurations. Specifically, it lacks the creation of subnets in both availability zones for both database and DMZ purposes.\n",
      "   - The Golden Terraform code includes specific route table associations for each subnet, which is missing in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure that the subnets are correctly configured across the specified availability zones, which could lead to network isolation or exposure to threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules for VPC and subnets, but it does not correctly configure them to meet the user’s requirements. The modules should be used to create the necessary subnets in the specified availability zones.\n",
      "\n",
      "To correct the generated code, it should be modified to create four subnets (two for database and two for DMZ) across two availability zones, and associate each subnet with the appropriate route table as specified in the Golden Terraform code.\n",

      "   - The generated code contains hard-coded credentials (`access_key` and `secret_key`), which is a significant security risk. These should be managed through environment variables or Terraform variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",

      "   - The generated code does not include the `aws_ram_resource_share`, `aws_ram_resource_association`, and `aws_ram_principal_association` resources, which are essential for sharing the transit gateway with the second account.\n",
      "   - The `aws_ec2_transit_gateway_vpc_attachment_accepter` resource is missing, which is necessary for the first account to accept the VPC attachment.\n",

      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - There are no syntax errors in the generated code, but the logical and functional issues make it incorrect.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not explicitly handle resource deletion or replacement, but the lack of proper configuration could lead to unintended consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the required Terraform version, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules (`transit_gateway` and `vpc`) without providing their definitions. This makes it unclear how these modules are configured and whether they meet the requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not correctly configure the networking components for cross-account VPC attachment. It lacks the necessary steps to ensure proper communication between the VPC and the transit gateway.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the necessary configurations for the VPN connection between AWS and GCP. It only includes a GCP VPN module without any reference to AWS VPN configurations.\n",
      "   - The `peer_ips` in the `gcp_vpn` module is set to `[\"10.0.0.0/24\"]`, which is not sufficient to establish a VPN connection with AWS. The Golden Terraform code includes detailed configurations for VPN tunnels, BGP settings, and forwarding rules, which are missing in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code assumes the existence of modules (`vpc`, `gcp_vpn`, `gcp_vm`) without providing their definitions. This makes it impossible to verify if the modules are correctly configured.\n",
      "   - The `vpc_name` and `subnet_name` variables in the `gcp_vm` module are not defined or passed correctly, leading to potential logical errors.\n",

      "   - The generated code does not include any mechanisms to ensure idempotency, such as proper resource dependencies and unique naming conventions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - There are no apparent syntax errors in the generated code, but the lack of complete module definitions makes it difficult to verify the overall syntax.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The validation for the `environment_type` variable is incorrect. The condition should check for valid values, but the current implementation will always fail because it uses `!=` for all valid values.\n",

      "3. **Logical Errors:**\n",
      "   - The generated code includes resources and configurations that are not relevant to setting up a GKE cluster, such as peering configurations and secondary IP ranges for peering subnets.\n",
      "   - The `google_compute_firewall_ingress_rule` resources are incorrectly named and configured, leading to potential misconfigurations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code may not produce consistent results when applied multiple times due to the improper use of resource dependencies and configurations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors:**\n",
      "   - The generated code has incomplete and incorrect syntax, such as the `google_compute_firewall_ingress_rule` resources and the `google_compute_instance_group_manager` resource.\n",

      "**Correct: No**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reason:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not explicitly address security group rules, which could lead to overly permissive access controls. The Golden Terraform code includes specific egress and ingress rules for the NAT security group.\n",

      "   - The generated code does not include detailed configurations for NAT instances or gateways, such as instance types, AMI IDs, or key names. The Golden Terraform code provides these details, ensuring the correct setup of NAT instances.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors:**\n",
      "   - The generated code lacks the logic to handle multiple availability zones and subnets dynamically. The Golden Terraform code uses local variables and conditional logic to manage these configurations effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure idempotency, as it lacks the detailed configurations and conditional checks present in the Golden Terraform code. This could lead to inconsistent results when applied multiple times.\n",

      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not provide sufficient detail to determine if it would inadvertently delete or replace critical resources. The Golden Terraform code includes specific resource configurations and tags to avoid such issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the required Terraform version, which could lead to compatibility issues. The Golden Terraform code includes a version constraint to ensure compatibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules:**\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules but does not provide sufficient detail on their implementation. The Golden Terraform code includes detailed configurations and variable definitions to ensure proper module usage.\n",

      "**Reason:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities:**\n",
      "   - **Hard-coded Credentials:** The generated code contains hard-coded credentials for MongoDB and the application server (`admin_password = \"YourAdminPassword\"`). This is a significant security risk as it exposes sensitive information in the codebase.\n",
      "   - **Improper Access Controls:** The firewall rules allow traffic from `0.0.0.0/0` for MongoDB and the application server, which is not secure. It should be restricted to specific IP ranges or internal networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration:**\n",
      "   - **Instance Types and Zones:** The generated code specifies `n1-standard-2` for both MongoDB and the application server, which may not be optimal for the application's requirements. The Golden Terraform code uses `n1-highmem-2` for MongoDB and `n1-highmem-4` for the application server.\n",
      "   - **Network Configuration:** The generated code does not include the creation of a VPC network with auto-created subnetworks as specified in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors:**\n",
      "   - **Resource Dependencies:** The generated code does not explicitly define dependencies between resources, which could lead to issues during the deployment process. The Golden Terraform code uses `depends_on` to ensure proper resource creation order.\n",
      "   - **Service Account Configuration:** The generated code does not handle the creation and assignment of roles to service accounts as comprehensively as the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues:**\n",
      "   - **Consistent Results:** The generated code lacks mechanisms to ensure consistent results when applied multiple times. The Golden Terraform code uses modules and dependencies to achieve idempotency.\n",
      "\n",

      "   - **Syntax Issues:** The generated code appears to be syntactically correct, but it lacks the comprehensive structure and modularity of the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement:**\n",
      "   - **Critical Resources:** The generated code does not explicitly handle the potential deletion or replacement of critical resources, which could lead to data loss or downtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues:**\n",
      "   - **Provider Versions:** The generated code does not specify the use of `google-beta` provider for certain resources, which may lead to compatibility issues. The Golden Terraform code uses `google-beta` for specific resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules:**\n",

      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues:**\n",
      "   - **VPC and Subnets:** The generated code does not create a VPC network with auto-created subnetworks as specified in the Golden Terraform code. This can lead to network isolation or exposure to threats.\n",

      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query requirements and has several issues when compared to the Golden Terraform code. Here are the specific issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses hard-coded credentials (`credentials = \"path-to-service-account-credentials\"`), which is a security risk. The Golden code uses `impersonate_service_account` for better security practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code creates a new Google Cloud project (`google_project`), which is not required by the user query. The user query assumes an existing project.\n",
      "   - The `google_project_iam_binding` resource is not necessary as the Golden code already handles impersonation via the provider configuration.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules for BigQuery dataset and table creation, but the source paths (`./modules/bigquery` and `./modules/storage`) are not defined or provided. This makes the code incomplete and non-functional.\n",
      "   - The dataset and table IDs in the generated code do not match the IDs specified in the Golden code (`covid19_cds_eu` and `global_cases_by_province`).\n",

      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules without defining their contents or ensuring they match the required configurations. This leads to incomplete and potentially incorrect infrastructure setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",

      "\n",
      "In summary, the generated Terraform code does not correctly implement the user query requirements and deviates significantly from the Golden Terraform code. It introduces security risks, logical errors, and incomplete configurations.\n",

      "**Reason:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the access key and secret key variables, which are essential for securely accessing AWS resources. These should be defined and managed securely, possibly using environment variables or AWS IAM roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the number of master and slave instances. The user query and the golden code indicate that there should be multiple instances for both masters and slaves.\n",
      "   - The `key_name` variable is missing, which is necessary for SSH access to the instances.\n",
      "   - The `ami_id` variable is used generically, but the golden code specifies different AMIs for different regions and instance types.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors:**\n",
      "   - The `module` blocks in `main.tf` are not correctly referencing the modules. The `source` attribute should point to the correct module paths, and the variables should be passed correctly.\n",
      "   - The `module-vpc.tf` and `module-security_group.tf` files are not structured as modules but as direct resource definitions. They should be modularized properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure idempotency, especially with the `aws_instance` resources. There is no mechanism to handle changes in the number of instances or their configurations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors:**\n",
      "   - The generated code appears to have some structural issues, such as missing variable definitions and incorrect module references, which could lead to syntax errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement:**\n",
      "   - There is no explicit handling of resource deletion or replacement, which could lead to unintended consequences if the infrastructure is modified.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the required Terraform or AWS provider versions, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not correctly use modules. The `module` blocks in `main.tf` should reference properly defined modules with appropriate input and output variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not fully configure the VPC and subnets as specified in the user query and golden code. The `public_subnet_cidr_block` and `availability_zones` variables are missing.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency:**\n",
      "    - The generated code does not optimize for performance and efficiency. For example, the instance types and AMIs are not specified as per the golden code, which could lead to suboptimal resource usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The generated Terraform code does not meet the user’s requirements as described in the query and does not align with the golden Terraform code. It lacks completeness, proper configuration, and adherence to best practices. The code needs significant revisions to address security, configuration, logical, and structural issues.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason:\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The RDS password is hard-coded in the generated Terraform code (`password = \"password\"`). This is a significant security risk as it exposes sensitive information in the codebase. The Golden Terraform code uses a variable for the RDS password, which is marked as sensitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the `availability_zone` correctly for the subnets. It hardcodes `eu-west-1a` for all subnets, whereas the Golden Terraform code distributes subnets across multiple availability zones (`eu-west-1a`, `eu-west-1b`, `eu-west-1c`) for high availability.\n",
      "   - The `cidr_block` for subnets in the generated code is incorrectly defined as `\"10.0.${count.index}/24\"`, which is not a valid CIDR block. The Golden Terraform code correctly defines different CIDR blocks for each subnet.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules for VPC, subnets, internet gateway, and RDS instance, but it does not provide the actual module definitions. Without these definitions, it is impossible to verify if the modules are correctly implemented.\n",
      "   - The `subnet_ids` and `security_group_ids` in the RDS instance module are referenced as `module.subnets.*.id` and `module.vpc.security_groups`, respectively. These references assume that the modules output these values, but this is not guaranteed without the module definitions.\n",
      "\n",

      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query and the Golden Terraform code requirements. Here are the specific issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses the `terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws` module for both the VPC and the internet gateway. This is incorrect because the internet gateway should be a separate resource, not a module. The module does not provide a separate internet gateway resource, and the correct way to create an internet gateway is to use the `aws_internet_gateway` resource.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The security group configuration in the generated code is incorrect. The user query specifies a security group with egress rules, but the generated code includes both ingress and egress rules. Additionally, the ingress rules are not specified in the user query.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Completeness**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the `aws_vpc` resource directly, which is required to set the `enable_dns_support` and `enable_dns_hostnames` attributes. Instead, it relies on the VPC module, which may not expose these attributes correctly.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the `aws_internet_gateway` resource directly, which is required to create the internet gateway with appropriate tagging.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Tagging**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include all the required tags (`BuiltBy`, `Name`) as specified in the Golden Terraform code. The tags are incomplete and do not follow the required format.\n",
      "\n",

This does not fully meet the user query's requirement for managing AWS resources across multiple regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Misuse of Modules:**\n",
      "   - The generated code directly uses modules within the same configuration file without specifying the provider alias for each module. This can lead to confusion and potential misconfiguration. Each module should explicitly reference the appropriate provider alias to ensure resources are created in the correct region.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Completeness:**\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues:**\n",

      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query and the Golden Terraform code requirements. Here are the specific issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The user query and Golden Terraform code specify creating a storage table directly using the `azurerm_storage_table` resource. The generated code, however, uses modules for both the storage account and the storage table, which is not aligned with the user query or the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "   - The `table_type` variable is not required as per the user query and Golden Terraform code. The `azurerm_storage_table` resource does not have a `table_type` attribute.\n",

      "2. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The `storage_account_name` in the `storage_table` module is being sourced from `module.storage_account.storage_account_name`, which assumes that the storage account module outputs this value. This is an unnecessary complexity since the storage account name should be directly passed as a variable, as shown in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "   - The `table_name` variable should be named `name` to match the Golden Terraform code and user query.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The use of modules for such a simple task adds unnecessary complexity. The user query and Golden Terraform code do not indicate the need for modules. The task can be accomplished with a single resource block for the storage table.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Completeness**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the actual resource definition for the storage table (`azurerm_storage_table`), which is essential to meet the user query requirements.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure idempotency for the provisioning scripts. The `remote-exec` provisioner should include checks to avoid re-running the same commands if they have already been executed.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code has a syntax error in the `connection` block within the `provisioner \"remote-exec\"` block. The `host` attribute should be `self.private_ip` instead of `self.instance_private_ip`.\n",

      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the required provider version, which could lead to compatibility issues with different versions of the AWS provider.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",

      "   - The `aws_route53_record` resources for SSL validation are redundant and incorrectly configured. The user query does not mention SSL certificate validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",

      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules:**\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules but does not provide the necessary input and output variables for each module. The Golden Terraform code does not use modules but provides a detailed and modular approach within a single configuration file.\n",

      "   - The generated code has two modules named `security_groups`, which will cause a conflict. Each module should have a unique name.\n",
      "   - The security group IDs are referenced incorrectly. The generated code assumes that `module.security_groups[0].id` and `module.security_groups[1].id` will provide the correct security group IDs, but this is not guaranteed.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure that the resources will be created consistently when applied multiple times. For example, the hard-coded AMI IDs might change, leading to different instances being created.\n",

      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules but does not provide the module definitions. This makes it difficult to verify if the modules are used correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not configure the route table associations correctly. It assumes that the `module.route_table` will handle this, but the specifics are not provided.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure that the instances are associated with the correct subnets and route tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",
      "    - The generated code does not optimize for performance and efficiency. For example, it does not use variables for instance types and AMIs, which could lead to suboptimal resource usage.\n",

      "**Correct: No**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reason:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incorrect Resource Configuration:**\n",
      "   - The generated Terraform code uses `google_organization_iam_policy` and `google_folder_iam_policy` resources, which are not the correct resources for setting up audit logging. The correct resources should be `google_project_iam_audit_config` and `google_folder_iam_audit_config` as shown in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "   - The `audit_logging_enabled` block is not a valid configuration for these resources. Instead, the `audit_log_config` block should be used to specify the log types (`DATA_READ`, `DATA_WRITE`, `ADMIN_READ`).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Logical Errors:**\n",
      "   - The `organization_id` and `folder_id` fields are not correctly set based on the `parent_type` variable. The Golden Terraform code uses conditional logic to set these fields correctly.\n",
      "   - The `data` sources for `google_organization` and `google_folder` are not used correctly. The Golden Terraform code does not require these data sources as it directly uses the `org_id` and `folder_id` variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Idempotency Issues:**\n",
      "   - The use of `count` in the Golden Terraform code ensures that only one of the resources (`google_project_iam_audit_config` or `google_folder_iam_audit_config`) is created based on the `parent_type`. The generated code does not handle this correctly, which could lead to idempotency issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Syntax Errors:**\n",
      "   - The `possible_values` attribute in the `variable` block is not a valid attribute in Terraform. The correct way to handle this is to use validation rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Completeness:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include all necessary configurations and resources as required by the user query. The Golden Terraform code includes conditional handling for both organization and folder audit logging, which is missing in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The generated Terraform code does not meet the user’s requirements as described in the query. It has incorrect resource configurations, logical errors, potential idempotency issues, and syntax errors. The Golden Terraform code provides a correct and complete configuration for setting up audit logging on either an organization or a folder in Google Cloud.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not meet the user query requirements and deviates significantly from the Golden Terraform code. Here are the specific issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses `google.api_service` and `google.api_endpoint` resources, which are not appropriate for setting up Google Cloud Endpoints. The correct resource to use is `google_endpoints_service`.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not enable the necessary APIs (`servicemanagement.googleapis.com` and `serviceusage.googleapis.com`), which are required for Google Cloud Endpoints.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the `template_file` data source to render the OpenAPI specification, which is necessary for configuring the Google Cloud Endpoints service.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not handle the undelete operation for the service endpoint, which is a critical step mentioned in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Completeness**:\n",
      "   - The generated code is missing several key components, such as the `google_project_service` resources to enable the necessary APIs and the `google_endpoints_service` resource to create the Cloud Endpoints service.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not provide outputs for the endpoint information, config ID, or name, which are required by the user query.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Best Practices**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not follow best practices for Google Cloud Endpoints setup, such as ensuring the service management and service usage APIs are enabled and handling the undelete operation for the service endpoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code attempts to associate an external IP with an API endpoint using `google_compute_address`, which is not the correct approach for Google Cloud Endpoints. The external IP should be specified in the OpenAPI specification.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the generated Terraform code does not correctly set up a Google Cloud Endpoints service as per the user query and Golden Terraform code. It lacks the necessary resources, configurations, and best practices required for a functional and secure setup.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason:\n",
      "1. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code specifies `vpc_endpoint_type = \"Interface\"`, which is not mentioned in the user query or the Golden Terraform code. The user query does not specify the type of VPC endpoint, and the Golden Terraform code does not include this attribute.\n",
      "   - The generated code includes `subnet_ids` and `security_group_ids`, which are not mentioned in the user query or the Golden Terraform code. These attributes are not required for the user’s request and add unnecessary complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The `depends_on` attribute in the generated code references `aws_route_table.vpc_route_table`, which is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This will cause a logical error as the dependency resource does not exist.\n",
      "   - The `dynamic \"policy\"` block is incorrectly used. The Golden Terraform code uses a conditional IAM policy document, whereas the generated code attempts to use a dynamic block with an incorrect structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Completeness**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the `data \"aws_vpc_endpoint_service\"` data source to fetch the service name, which is crucial for creating the VPC endpoint as shown in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not handle the optional IAM policy correctly. The Golden Terraform code uses a conditional IAM policy document, while the generated code uses a dynamic block that does not achieve the same functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code includes `subnet_ids` and `security_group_ids`, which are not required for the user’s request and could lead to network configuration issues if not properly managed.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The `lifecycle` block with `create_before_destroy = true` is not necessary for the VPC endpoint resource and could lead to unintended infrastructure changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the generated Terraform code does not meet the user’s requirements as described in the query and does not align with the Golden Terraform code. It introduces unnecessary complexity and logical errors that could lead to incorrect infrastructure behavior.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query and Golden Terraform code requirements. Here are the specific issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The IAM policy in the generated code is too permissive, allowing `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, and `s3:DeleteObject` on all resources within the VPC endpoint. This could expose the infrastructure to security risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The `aws_vpc_endpoint` resource in the generated code is hardcoded to use the S3 service (`service_name = \"com.amazonaws.${var.region}.s3\"`), whereas the Golden Terraform code allows for dynamic service names via the `var.service` variable.\n",
      "   - The `aws_rds_parameter_group` in the generated code is configured for `postgres10`, while the Golden Terraform code specifies `postgres13`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include a mechanism to handle dynamic dependencies and outputs as specified in the Golden Terraform code. The `null_resource` with `triggers` and `depends_on` is missing.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not dynamically handle the IAM policy document creation based on the presence of `var.policy`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure idempotency for the IAM policy document creation, which could lead to inconsistent results when applied multiple times.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - No syntax errors were found in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - No inadvertent deletion or replacement of critical resources was found.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the required Terraform version, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules, but it does not ensure that the modules are correctly handling input and output variables as required by the user query and Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the `route_table_ids` for the VPC endpoint, which is necessary for proper networking configuration.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",
      "    - The generated code includes a large number of redundant parameters in the `aws_rds_parameter_group` resource, which could lead to unnecessary complexity and suboptimal performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query and Golden Terraform code requirements due to security vulnerabilities, incorrect resource configurations, logical errors, and missing dynamic dependencies and outputs.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not meet the user query requirements and has several issues when compared to the Golden Terraform code. Here are the specific reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses the `terraform-google-modules/lb/google` module, which is not specifically designed for serverless NEGs (Network Endpoint Groups) required for Cloud Run services. The Golden Terraform code uses the `terraform-google-modules/lb-http/google//modules/serverless_negs` module, which is appropriate for this use case.\n",
      "   - The `backend` configuration in the generated code does not correctly reference a Cloud Run service. The Golden Terraform code correctly sets up a `google_compute_region_network_endpoint_group` with `network_endpoint_type = \"SERVERLESS\"` and links it to the Cloud Run service.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code specifies `target_scheme = \"INTERNAL\"`, which is incorrect for a publicly accessible load balancer. The Golden Terraform code correctly configures the load balancer to be publicly accessible.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the necessary IAM configuration to make the Cloud Run service publicly accessible. The Golden Terraform code includes a `google_cloud_run_service_iam_member` resource to grant the `roles/run.invoker` role to `allUsers`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not explicitly configure SSL certificates correctly. The Golden Terraform code uses `managed_ssl_certificate_domains` to provision a managed SSL certificate for the specified domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code references `subnet_names`, which is not relevant for a serverless NEG setup. The Golden Terraform code does not require subnet configuration as it uses serverless NEGs.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Completeness**:\n",
      "   - The generated code is missing several critical components, such as the `google_compute_region_network_endpoint_group` and the correct setup for the Cloud Run service IAM member, which are present in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code incorrectly uses the `terraform-google-modules/lb/google` module instead of the `terraform-google-modules/lb-http/google//modules/serverless_negs` module, which is specifically designed for integrating with Cloud Run services.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the generated Terraform code does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the user query and does not align with the Golden Terraform code. It has several configuration and logical errors, making it unsuitable for the intended purpose.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query and the Golden Terraform code requirements. Here are the specific issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - Hard-coded credentials are present in the IAM, RDS, and Dockerhub modules (`password = \"password123\"`). This is a significant security risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The `etcd` module is missing the necessary configurations such as `cluster_desired_capacity`, `image_type`, `keypair`, `allow_ssh_cidr`, and AWS-specific configurations.\n",
      "   - The `dockerhub` module is missing configurations like `image_type`, `cluster_desired_capacity`, `root_volume_size`, `docker_volume_size`, `keypair`, `allow_ssh_cidr`, and AWS-specific configurations.\n",
      "   - The `worker_nodes` module is missing configurations like `root_volume_size`, `docker_volume_size`, `keypair`, `allow_ssh_cidr`, and AWS-specific configurations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The `etcd` module should have an odd number for `cluster_desired_capacity` (e.g., 3, 5, 7) for high availability, but this is not specified in the generated code.\n",
      "   - The `ec2_instances` module does not differentiate between different types of instances (admiral, dockerhub, etcd, worker nodes) as required by the user query.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The hard-coded credentials and static configurations could lead to inconsistent results when applied multiple times.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - No syntax errors were detected, but the logical and functional issues are more critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - No specific issues detected, but the lack of proper configuration could lead to unintended resource behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - No specific issues detected, but the code should be reviewed for compatibility with the specific Terraform and AWS provider versions in use.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The modules are not used correctly. For example, the `ec2_instances` module should be split into separate modules for admiral, dockerhub, etcd, and worker nodes, each with its specific configurations.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the subnets for different modules (admiral, dockerhub, etcd, worker nodes) as required by the user query and Golden Terraform code.\n",

The code needs significant revisions to align with the specified requirements and best practices.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason:\n",
      "1. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",

      "   - The generated code does not include the `terraform` block specifying the required Terraform version, which is present in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the `provider \"aws\"` block specifying the region as `us-east-1`, which is specified in the Golden Terraform code. Instead, it uses `us-west-2`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses a different module source path (`\"./modules/web-server-cluster\"`) compared to the Golden Terraform code (`\"../../../../modules/services/webserver-cluster\"`). This could lead to inconsistencies if the module definitions differ.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code specifies a `subnet_id` directly, but it does not ensure that the subnet is part of a VPC or that the VPC is correctly configured. The Golden Terraform code does not specify subnet details, implying that it might be handled within the module.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Completeness**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the `variable` blocks for `db_remote_state_bucket` and `db_remote_state_key`, which are necessary for integrating with the remote database state stored in an S3 bucket.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the `output` block for `elb_dns_name`, which is present in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify any security groups for the web server instances, which could lead to improper access controls. The Golden Terraform code implies that security groups might be handled within the module.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include lifecycle rules or other configurations to ensure that resources are not inadvertently replaced or deleted, which could lead to instability.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The user query specifies a specific AMI (`ami-40d28157`) and instance type (`m4.large`), but the generated code uses the latest Amazon Linux AMI and `t2.micro` instance type. This does not meet the user's requirements.\n",

      "10. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",
      "    - The use of `t2.micro` instances instead of `m4.large` could lead to performance issues, as `t2.micro` instances are less powerful.\n",

      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",
      "    - The generated code does not provide enough detail to evaluate performance and efficiency. However, the lack of multi-region configurations for managed instance groups and load balancers could lead to suboptimal performance and availability.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the generated Terraform code is incomplete and does not fully meet the user query requirements or the Golden Terraform code. It lacks critical components such as load balancers, multi-region configurations, and detailed module configurations.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query and Golden Terraform code requirements. Here are the specific issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The security group rules are hard-coded to allow ingress traffic from any IP address (`cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"]`). This is a significant security risk as it exposes the Consul service to the entire internet. The Golden Terraform code suggests using `allowed_public_cidrs` for more controlled access.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The `security_group_rules` variable is not correctly utilized. The `aws_instance` resource directly references `var.security_groups`, which is not properly defined as a list of security group IDs.\n",
      "   - The `ami` is hard-coded (`ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0`). This should be parameterized or dynamically fetched based on the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The `module \"consul_nodes\"` is referenced but not defined. The source path `./modules/consul_nodes` is not provided, and the module's implementation is missing.\n",
      "   - The `security_groups` variable in the `aws_instance` resource should be a list of security group IDs, not a single security group rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The code does not ensure idempotency for the security group rules. Each run could potentially create new security group rules, leading to inconsistent states.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - The `security_group_rules` variable is defined as a map but used incorrectly in the `aws_instance` resource. This will cause syntax errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - No immediate issues, but the incorrect use of security groups could lead to unintended resource replacements.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the required Terraform or provider versions, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The `consul_nodes` module is referenced but not defined, leading to incomplete infrastructure deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The `subnet_ids` variable is hard-coded, which may not align with the user's customizable parameters requirement. The Golden Terraform code suggests using `public_subnets` and `private_subnets`.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",
      "    - The use of `t2.micro` instances may not be suitable for a production Consul deployment, depending on the workload. This should be customizable based on user requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "1. **Security**: Use controlled CIDR blocks for ingress traffic and parameterize security group IDs.\n",
      "2. **Resource Configuration**: Correctly define and use security group IDs. Parameterize the AMI.\n",
      "3. **Logical Structure**: Define the `consul_nodes` module or remove the reference if not used.\n",
      "4. **Idempotency**: Ensure security group rules are managed idempotently.\n",
      "5. **Syntax**: Correct the use of variables and ensure proper syntax.\n",
      "6. **Versioning**: Specify required Terraform and provider versions.\n",
      "7. **Networking**: Use variables for subnets and security groups as per the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "8. **Performance**: Allow customization of instance types based on workload requirements.\n",

      "By addressing these issues, the generated Terraform code can be aligned with the user query and Golden Terraform code, ensuring a secure, correct, and efficient deployment of the Consul service architecture on AWS.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query and Golden Terraform code requirements. Here are the specific issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not have any hard-coded credentials, which is good. However, it does not specify the source ranges for some firewall rules, which could expose the infrastructure to security risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses `google_compute_disk` and `google_compute_machine_image` resources, which are not necessary for the user query. The user query specifies using a specific Ubuntu image, which can be directly referenced without creating a custom image.\n",
      "   - The machine type for the NAT instance is set to `n1-standard-1`, whereas the Golden Terraform code uses `f1-micro`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not create NAT instances across multiple zones as specified in the user query. It only creates a single NAT instance in `us-central1-a`.\n",
      "   - The `google_compute_firewall` rules in the generated code do not match the rules specified in the Golden Terraform code. For example, the Golden Terraform code includes rules for internal communication and specific tags, which are missing in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not seem to have any idempotency issues, but the incorrect resource configurations and logical errors could lead to unintended infrastructure changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - There are no syntax errors in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - There is no indication of inadvertent deletion or replacement of critical resources in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify any version constraints for the Google provider, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",

      "**Correct: No**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reason:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include any specific security configurations for the Kubernetes cluster, such as network policies or pod security policies, which could expose the infrastructure to security risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration:**\n",
      "   - The generated code creates a Kubernetes cluster with a single node pool and a single node, which may not be sufficient for running both Prometheus and Thanos in a production environment.\n",
      "   - The `kubernetes_service` resources for Prometheus and Thanos are configured with `ClusterIP` type, which does not expose the services externally. This contradicts the user query which mentions DNS and IP configurations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors:**\n",
      "   - The `kubernetes_ingress` resources for Prometheus and Thanos are configured with hardcoded hostnames (`prometheus.example.com` and `thanos.example.com`), which may not be suitable for different environments and projects.\n",
      "   - The `module` blocks for Prometheus and Thanos reference non-existent Terraform modules (`terraform-google-modules/kubernetes-engine/google//modules/prometheus` and `terraform-google-modules/kubernetes-engine/google//modules/thanos`), which will result in errors during execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include any mechanisms to ensure idempotency, such as checking for existing resources before creating new ones. This could lead to unintended infrastructure changes when applied multiple times.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not contain any syntax errors, but it references non-existent modules, which will cause errors during execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include any mechanisms to prevent the inadvertent deletion or replacement of critical resources, such as using `lifecycle` blocks with `prevent_destroy`.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the required versions of Terraform or the Google provider, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules:**\n",
      "   - The generated code references non-existent modules for Prometheus and Thanos, which indicates a misuse of modules.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include any specific networking configurations, such as VPCs, subnets, or security groups, which could lead to network isolation or exposure to threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency:**\n",
      "    - The generated code creates a Kubernetes cluster with a single node, which may not be sufficient for running both Prometheus and Thanos efficiently. This could lead to performance issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The generated Terraform code does not meet the user’s requirements as described in the query and does not follow best practices for the chosen cloud provider.

      "\n",
      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query and Golden Terraform code requirements. Here are the specific issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses `google_compute_address` with `address_type = \"INTERNAL\"` and `purpose = \"VPC_PEERING\"`, which is not suitable for public DNS records. The Golden Terraform code uses `google_compute_global_address` for static IPs, which is more appropriate for public DNS records.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the logic to conditionally create resources based on the `enable` flags for Data Repo, Grafana, and Prometheus. The Golden Terraform code uses `count = var.enable ? 1 : 0` to conditionally create resources.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not correctly handle the DNS record creation for each service. The Golden Terraform code includes `google_dns_record_set` resources for each service, which are missing in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure that the DNS records and static IPs are created only if the corresponding `enable` flag is set to true. This could lead to inconsistent results when applied multiple times.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code references modules for Data Repo, Grafana, and Prometheus without providing the actual module definitions. The Golden Terraform code does not use separate modules but includes all necessary resources directly in the configuration.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses `google_compute_address` with `address_type = \"INTERNAL\"`, which is not suitable for public DNS records. The Golden Terraform code correctly uses `google_compute_global_address` for public IPs.\n",

      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The modules are not used correctly. The `peering` module does not include dependencies or configurations for IAP firewall rules as specified in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "   - The `project_outputs` variable is incorrectly used as an output. Outputs should be defined using the `output` block, not as a variable.\n",

      "   - The generated code does not specify the Terraform or provider versions, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules but does not provide sufficient details on how these modules are defined. The modules should be self-contained and include all necessary configurations.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the `vpc_id` and `subnet_id` for the security groups and EC2 instances, which are crucial for proper networking configuration.\n",

      "In summary, the generated Terraform code does not meet the user’s requirements as described in the query and does not align with the Golden Terraform code. It lacks proper resource configuration, logical linking, and necessary details for a complete and secure deployment.\n",
      "**Correct: No**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reason:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not explicitly handle the impersonation of the service account for the Terraform provider, which is a critical security requirement mentioned in the user query. The Golden Terraform code uses `impersonate_service_account` for the `google` and `google-beta` providers, ensuring that Terraform operations are performed using the specified service account. This is missing in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration:**\n",
      "   - The generated code creates a new service account (`google_service_account.ci_cd_service_account`) and assigns it the `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role. However, the user query specifies using a specific service account for impersonation, not creating a new one. This does not align with the user's requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the necessary configurations for managing multiple repositories and artifact repositories as specified in the user query. The Golden Terraform code includes a module (`cicd_pipeline`) that handles multiple repositories and artifact repositories, which is missing in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure idempotency for the service account and IAM bindings. If the service account already exists, the code might fail or cause unintended changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors:**\n",
      "   - There are no syntax errors in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not inadvertently delete or replace critical resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code specifies `google` provider version `~> 4.0`, which is compatible with the latest Terraform versions. However, it does not include the `google-beta` provider, which might be necessary for certain resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules:**\n",
      "   - The generated code attempts to use modules for repositories and artifact repositories, but it does not provide the complete implementation or ensure that these modules align with the user's requirements. The Golden Terraform code uses a single module (`cicd_pipeline`) to manage all aspects of the CI/CD pipeline, which is more cohesive and maintainable.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The generated Terraform code does not meet the user's requirements as described in the query. It lacks the necessary configurations for impersonating a specific service account, managing multiple repositories, and handling artifact repositories. Additionally, it does not follow the best practices demonstrated in the Golden Terraform code, such as using a cohesive module to manage the entire CI/CD pipeline. Therefore, the generated code is not correct.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query requirements and the Golden Terraform code. Here are the specific issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not handle sensitive data securely. For example, the `DB_PASS` is hard-coded in the environment variables, which is a security risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include Cloudflare DNS configuration, which is a critical part of the user query.\n",
      "   - The SAML authentication configuration is missing in the generated code.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the necessary environment variables for SAML authentication, email alerting, and other configurations specified in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not correctly configure the ALB listener rules and target groups as specified in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the `random_id` resource for generating access token hash, which is necessary for the application.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure idempotency for certain resources, such as the ECS task definition and service. The Golden Terraform code uses a template file for the task definition, ensuring consistent results.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - There are no syntax errors in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not inadvertently delete or replace critical resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the required Terraform and provider versions, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses custom modules (`./modules/ecs`, `./modules/slack_webhook`, `./modules/email_alerts`) without providing their definitions, making it difficult to verify their correctness and completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the necessary VPC, subnet, and security group configurations as specified in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",
      "    - The generated code does not optimize resource usage. For example, the ECS task definition uses a fixed CPU and memory configuration without considering the application's requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the generated Terraform code is not correct because it lacks critical configurations and does not fully meet the user query requirements. It also has security vulnerabilities and logical errors that need to be addressed.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason:\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include any hard-coded credentials, which is good. However, it does not handle IAM policies and roles with the same level of detail as the Golden Terraform code, potentially leading to improper access controls.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not fully configure the IAM roles and policies as specified in the user query and Golden Terraform code. It uses a generic policy attachment without specifying the detailed permissions required for ECR access.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not correctly handle the lifecycle policy for the ECR repository. The lifecycle policy is specified in a JSON file, but the Golden Terraform code dynamically generates this policy using variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules, which can help with idempotency, but it does not ensure that the IAM roles and policies are correctly managed. This could lead to inconsistent results when applied multiple times.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - There are no apparent syntax errors in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not handle the creation and management of IAM roles and policies in a way that ensures they are not inadvertently deleted or replaced.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify Terraform or provider versions, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules but does not provide the same level of detail and customization as the Golden Terraform code. The modules are not parameterized to handle different roles and policies dynamically.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - Not applicable as the user query and Golden Terraform code do not involve networking components.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",
      "    - The generated code is less efficient in terms of managing IAM roles and policies. It does not dynamically handle multiple roles and their permissions as the Golden Terraform code does.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the generated Terraform code does not meet the user’s requirements as described in the query and does not follow best practices for managing IAM roles and policies. It lacks the completeness and detail provided in the Golden Terraform code, leading to potential security vulnerabilities, incorrect resource configurations, and logical errors.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - No hard-coded credentials or improper access controls are present.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the `aws_lambda_permission` resource, which is necessary to allow Alexa to invoke the Lambda function. This is a critical omission.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The `aws_iam_policy_document` resource is used correctly, but the `aws_iam_policy` and `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment` resources are not necessary. Instead, an `aws_iam_role_policy` resource should be used directly, as shown in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code should be idempotent, but the missing `aws_lambda_permission` resource could lead to inconsistent behavior when trying to invoke the Lambda function from Alexa.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - No syntax errors are present in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - No inadvertent deletion or replacement of critical resources is evident.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify a required Terraform version, which could lead to compatibility issues. The Golden Terraform code specifies `required_version = \">= 0.12\"`.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - No misuse of modules is evident, but the generated code does not use modules at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - No networking components are involved in this specific configuration.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",
      "    - The generated code is relatively efficient but lacks completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary of Missing Elements:\n",
      "1. **aws_lambda_permission**: This resource is necessary to allow Alexa to invoke the Lambda function.\n",
      "2. **aws_iam_role_policy**: Instead of using `aws_iam_policy` and `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment`, the Golden Terraform code uses `aws_iam_role_policy` directly.\n",

      "\n",
      "Reason:\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include variables for sensitive information like AWS access keys, which are present in the Golden Terraform code. This could lead to hard-coded credentials if not handled properly.\n",
      "   - The `user_data` script is not secured and could be exposed in logs or other outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses a hard-coded AMI ID (`ami-0261755bbs`), which may not be suitable for all regions or use cases. The Golden Terraform code uses a variable for the AMI ID, making it more flexible.\n",
      "   - The instance type in the generated code is `t2.micro`, which may not be sufficient for running OpenWhisk. The Golden Terraform code uses `t2.medium`, which is more appropriate for this use case.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the necessary provisioning scripts to configure Docker and deploy OpenWhisk as specified in the user query. The Golden Terraform code includes these steps using `remote-exec` and `file` provisioners.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses `user_data` for provisioning, which can lead to idempotency issues. The Golden Terraform code uses `remote-exec` provisioners, which are more reliable for ensuring idempotent operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - No syntax errors were found in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - No issues related to resource deletion or replacement were found.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - No specific version compatibility issues were identified, but the lack of variable definitions for sensitive information could lead to problems with different Terraform versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not use modules, which is acceptable for small configurations but could be a missed opportunity for better organization and reusability.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code correctly configures the security group for SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS access, similar to the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",
      "    - The generated code uses `t2.micro`, which may not provide sufficient performance for running OpenWhisk. The Golden Terraform code uses `t2.medium`, which is more appropriate.\n",

It lacks the necessary provisioning scripts for Docker and OpenWhisk, uses a potentially insufficient instance type, and does not handle sensitive information securely.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query and Golden Terraform code requirements. Here are the specific issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - **Hard-coded Credentials**: The generated code includes hard-coded AWS credentials (`aws_secret_access_key` and `aws_access_key_id`), which is a significant security risk. These should be managed securely, for example, using environment variables or AWS IAM roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - **API Keys Configuration**: The generated code uses a map for `api_keys`, whereas the Golden Terraform code uses a list of strings. This discrepancy could lead to incorrect handling of API keys.\n",
      "   - **Logging Level**: The user query specifies a logging level, but the generated code defaults to \"info\" instead of using a variable or the specified level.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - **Module Source**: The generated code uses a local module source (`\"./modules/docker_service\"`), whereas the Golden Terraform code uses a remote module source from a Git repository. This could lead to different implementations and behaviors.\n",
      "   - **Container Definitions**: The Golden Terraform code includes a `template_file` data source to render container definitions, which is missing in the generated code. This is crucial for defining the Docker-based service.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - **State Management**: The generated code includes resources for S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for state locking, which is good. However, the Lambda function for state locking is not typically required for Terraform state management and could introduce unnecessary complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - **Duplicate Resource**: The generated code has a duplicate `aws_lambda_permission` resource, which will cause a syntax error.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - **Not Applicable**: No specific issues related to resource deletion or replacement were identified.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - **Provider Versions**: The generated code does not specify provider versions, which could lead to compatibility issues. The Golden Terraform code specifies versions for the AWS and template providers.\n",

      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - **Module Inputs**: The generated code does not align with the module inputs expected by the Golden Terraform code. For example, the Golden Terraform code expects `container_definitions`, `api_enabled`, `api_quota_limit`, etc., which are missing in the generated code.\n",

      "   - The generated code defines a custom module for identity groups, but it does not align with the Golden Terraform code's approach of using the `terraform-google-modules/group/google` module. This leads to a mismatch in the expected functionality and structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Best Practices**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not use the `google-beta` provider, which is specified in the user query and Golden Terraform code. The `google-beta` provider is necessary to use beta features.\n",

      "\n",
      "5. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The `google_service_directory_group_member` resource in the generated code has a logical error in the `email` attribute. The use of `element(var.members, index(element(var.members, 0), var.index))` is incorrect and will likely result in errors.\n",

      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason:\n",
      "1. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**: The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user’s requirements as described in the query. The user requested a configuration for setting up Google Cloud healthcare datasets with specified consent, DICOM, FHIR, and HL7 v2 stores in a given project and region. The generated code does not include the creation of healthcare datasets, which is a critical part of the user’s request.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Misuse of Modules**: The generated code does not utilize modules for reusability and maintainability as suggested in the Golden Terraform code. The Golden Terraform code uses a module to manage healthcare datasets, which is a best practice for modular and maintainable infrastructure as code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Completeness**: The generated code is incomplete as it does not include the creation of healthcare datasets. The Golden Terraform code includes a module that creates healthcare datasets and associates consent, DICOM, FHIR, and HL7 v2 stores with each dataset. The generated code only creates consent policies and stores without associating them with any datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Logical Errors**: The generated code assumes that a healthcare consent policy is required for creating DICOM, FHIR, and HL7 v2 stores, which is not necessarily true. The Golden Terraform code does not include a consent policy, indicating that it is not a mandatory requirement for creating these stores.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Idempotency Issues**: The generated code does not use variables for project ID and region, which could lead to inconsistencies when applied in different environments. The Golden Terraform code uses variables for project ID and region, ensuring that the code is idempotent and can be applied consistently across different environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Security Vulnerabilities**: The generated code does not include credentials for the Google Cloud provider, which could lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly. The Golden Terraform code includes a credentials file for the Google Cloud provider, ensuring secure access to the cloud environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the generated Terraform code does not meet the user’s requirements, lacks best practices for modularity and maintainability, and is incomplete. The Golden Terraform code provides a more comprehensive and modular approach to setting up Google Cloud healthcare datasets with specified consent, DICOM, FHIR, and HL7 v2 stores.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query and the Golden Terraform code requirements. Here are the specific issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include variables for `aws_access_key` and `aws_secret_key`, which are necessary for secure access to AWS resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses a different instance type (`t2.medium`) compared to the Golden Terraform code (`t2.small`).\n",
      "   - The AMI ID in the generated code (`ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0`) does not match any of the AMI IDs specified in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The `azs` variable in the `vpc` module is incorrectly set to `[\"${var.region}-us-west-2a\", \"${var.region}-us-west-2b\"]`. This should be dynamically determined based on the region.\n",
      "   - The `public_subnets` and `private_subnets` are set to the same values, which is not logically correct. They should be distinct.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include any mechanism to ensure idempotency, such as using unique names or tags for resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - There are no syntax errors in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - There is no indication of inadvertent deletion or replacement of critical resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the required Terraform or provider versions, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The `rancher_cluster` module is used, but it is not clear if this module exists or if it is correctly configured. The Golden Terraform code does not use this module, so its inclusion is questionable.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include detailed networking configurations such as security groups, route tables, or internet gateways, which are essential for a complete VPC setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",
      "    - The generated code does not optimize for performance and efficiency. For example, it does not specify the number of Rancher servers or hosts, which are critical for scaling the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the generated Terraform code is not correct because it fails to meet the user’s requirements and the Golden Terraform code in several critical areas, including security, resource configuration, logical correctness, and completeness.\n",
      "**Correct: No**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reason:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities:**\n",
      "   - **Focus:** The generated code does not explicitly show any hard-coded credentials or improper access controls. However, the service account email is hard-coded, which is not a best practice. It should be parameterized or managed securely.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration:**\n",
      "   - **Focus:** The generated code uses an outdated version of the GKE module (`1.3.0`), whereas the Golden Terraform code uses a more recent version (`~> 28.0`). This could lead to missing features or configurations.\n",
      "   - The `google_project_service` resource only enables the `container.googleapis.com` API, whereas the Golden Terraform code enables multiple necessary APIs (`logging.googleapis.com`, `monitoring.googleapis.com`, `stackdriver.googleapis.com`, `gkehub.googleapis.com`, `connectgateway.googleapis.com`).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors:**\n",
      "   - **Focus:** The generated code does not include the secondary IP ranges for pods and services, which are crucial for GKE clusters with IP aliasing enabled.\n",
      "   - The `google_compute_subnetwork` resource uses a `/16` CIDR block, which is different from the `/17` block used in the Golden Terraform code. This could lead to IP address conflicts or insufficient IP addresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues:**\n",
      "   - **Focus:** The use of `null_resource` with `local-exec` provisioners for deploying NGINX is not idempotent. Running the Terraform code multiple times could lead to inconsistent states.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors:**\n",
      "   - **Focus:** There are no apparent syntax errors in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement:**\n",
      "   - **Focus:** The generated code does not show any inadvertent deletion or replacement of critical resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues:**\n",
      "   - **Focus:** The generated code uses an outdated version of the GKE module, which may not be compatible with the latest Terraform and provider versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules:**\n",
      "   - **Focus:** The generated code does not use the `terraform-google-modules/network/google` module for VPC and subnet creation, which is a best practice for modular and maintainable infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues:**\n",
      "   - **Focus:** The generated code does not configure secondary IP ranges for pods and services, which is essential for GKE clusters with IP aliasing enabled.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency:**\n",
      "    - **Focus:** The generated code does not show any unnecessary complexity or suboptimal resource usage. However, the use of `null_resource` with `local-exec` provisioners is not efficient and should be replaced with proper Terraform resources or modules.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user's requirements and does not follow best practices as outlined in the Golden Terraform code. It has several issues related to outdated module versions, missing necessary API enablement, incorrect resource configurations, and non-idempotent deployment methods. Therefore, it is not correct.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason:\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The generated code contains hard-coded credentials for the PostgreSQL database (`username = \"admin\"` and `password = \"admin\"`). This is a significant security risk and should be avoided. Instead, use Terraform variables or a secrets management service to handle sensitive information.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the OpenShift cluster configuration. The user query specifically asks for deploying an OpenShift cluster, which is missing in the generated code.\n",
      "   - The PostgreSQL engine version in the generated code is `12.4`, whereas the Golden Terraform code specifies `9.6.3`. This discrepancy needs to be addressed to meet the user's requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not create the necessary subnets for the OpenShift cluster. The Golden Terraform code includes subnets for both the OpenShift cluster and the PostgreSQL database, which are missing in the generated code.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not output the connection details for the OpenShift cluster, which is a requirement in the user query.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure idempotency for the OpenShift cluster resources since they are not defined. This could lead to inconsistent infrastructure states.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - No syntax errors were found in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not handle the deletion or replacement of critical resources, particularly the OpenShift cluster, as it is not defined.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the Terraform or provider versions, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules for VPC, security group, and RDS, but it does not include a module for the OpenShift cluster, which is a critical part of the user's requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not configure the necessary subnets for the OpenShift cluster, which could lead to network isolation or exposure to threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",
      "    - The generated code uses a `db.t2.micro` instance for the PostgreSQL database, which may not be sufficient for production workloads. The Golden Terraform code specifies a `db.t2.large` instance, which is more appropriate for better performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the generated Terraform code does not meet the user's requirements for deploying an OpenShift cluster with PostgreSQL database support. It lacks the necessary configurations for the OpenShift cluster, has hard-coded credentials, and does not output the required connection details. The code needs significant modifications to align with the user's query and the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason: The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user query requirements and has several issues when compared to the Golden Terraform code. Here are the specific reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The generated code hardcodes the project ID and service account email, which is not a best practice. These should be passed as variables for better security and flexibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The IAM policy configuration in the generated code is incorrect. The `google_project_iam_binding` resource does not support `role_ids` and the `condition` block is not properly configured for the intended use case.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include the necessary IAM policies for BigQuery datasets and tables as specified in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules for BigQuery datasets, tables, and storage buckets, but the source paths (`./modules/bq_dataset`, `./modules/bq_table`, `./modules/gcp_bucket`) are not provided, making it unclear if these modules exist or are correctly configured.\n",
      "   - The `dataset_id` and `table_id` in the module outputs are not correctly referenced, which could lead to logical errors in resource creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure idempotency for the IAM policy. The condition expression is not correctly defined, which could lead to inconsistent results when applied multiple times.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - The `google_project_iam_binding` resource has an incorrect attribute `role_ids`, which is not valid in Terraform. This will cause a syntax error.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not handle the lifecycle of resources properly, especially for the storage bucket. The `force_destroy` attribute is not set, which could lead to unintended data loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the required provider version, which could lead to compatibility issues with different versions of the Google provider.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules without specifying the input and output variables correctly. This misuse can lead to incorrect resource creation and maintenance issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include any networking configuration, which might be necessary depending on the overall infrastructure setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",
      "    - The generated code does not optimize the resource configurations for performance and efficiency. For example, the storage bucket configuration is minimal and does not include important settings like versioning or logging.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the generated Terraform code does not meet the user’s requirements as described in the query and does not follow best practices. It lacks completeness, has logical and syntax errors, and does not ensure security and idempotency.\n",
      "**Correct: No**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reason:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities:**\n",
      "   - No hard-coded credentials or improper access controls are evident in the provided code.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not correctly configure the Google Cloud Datastore index resource. The `google_datastore_index` resource is not a valid Terraform resource. The correct approach involves using local files and null resources to manage Datastore indexes, as shown in the Golden Terraform Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not follow the correct logic for managing Google Cloud Datastore indexes. The Golden Terraform Code uses local files and null resources to create and destroy index files, which is not reflected in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure idempotency. The Golden Terraform Code uses SHA1 hash checks to trigger changes, ensuring that the same configuration does not result in unintended changes. This mechanism is missing in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors:**\n",
      "   - There are no syntax errors in the generated code, but the logical structure and resource usage are incorrect.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not handle the deletion of indexes correctly. The Golden Terraform Code includes a provisioner to destroy indexes, which is missing in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the required Terraform and provider versions, which could lead to compatibility issues. The Golden Terraform Code specifies the required versions for Terraform and providers.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules:**\n",
      "   - The generated code attempts to use a module for managing Datastore indexes, but the module definition is incorrect and does not align with the Golden Terraform Code's approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues:**\n",
      "   - Not applicable in this context as the focus is on Datastore indexes.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency:**\n",
      "    - The generated code does not follow the efficient approach of using local files and null resources to manage Datastore indexes, as shown in the Golden Terraform Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The generated Terraform code does not meet the user’s requirements as described in the query and does not align with the Golden Terraform Code. It lacks the correct resource configuration, logical structure, and mechanisms to ensure idempotency and proper index management. The Golden Terraform Code provides a more accurate and efficient approach to managing Google Cloud Datastore indexes.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason: The generated Terraform code has several issues that need to be addressed to meet the user query and align with the Golden Terraform code. Here are the specific issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The `source_ranges` is set to `[\"0.0.0.0/0\"]`, which allows SSH access from any IP address. This is a significant security risk. It would be better to restrict this to a specific IP range or use a smaller range (e.g., `/32`).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The `google_compute_firewall` resource in the generated code does not include the `project` attribute, which is necessary to specify the Google Cloud project.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The `module \"bastion_host\"` is defined twice, once in the main configuration and once in the module directory. This redundancy can cause confusion and potential conflicts.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code should ensure that the firewall rule is consistently applied without unintended changes. The lack of the `project` attribute could lead to issues when applying the configuration multiple times.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - There are no syntax errors in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - There are no issues related to resource deletion or replacement.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - There are no explicit version compatibility issues, but it's always good to specify the provider version to avoid potential issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The module usage is somewhat redundant and not well-structured. The module should be used to encapsulate the bastion host configuration, and the firewall rule should be defined outside the module.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The `network` attribute in the `google_compute_firewall` resource should directly reference the VPC name variable, not through a module output.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",
      "    - The code is not overly complex, but the redundancy in module definitions could be streamlined for better maintainability.\n",

      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The `resilience_mode` block in the generated code is incorrectly defined. It should be a simple attribute, not a block.\n",
      "   - The `scheduling` block in the generated code is not a valid configuration for `google_composer_environment`. Instead, it should use `maintenance_window` and other related attributes as shown in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure idempotency for the `google_composer_environment` resource due to missing configurations and dynamic blocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not have any apparent syntax errors, but it lacks the necessary structure and attributes to be functionally correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not handle potential resource deletions or replacements properly due to missing configurations.\n",

      "**Correct: No**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reason:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities:**\n",
      "   - **Hard-coded Credentials:** The generated code contains hard-coded credentials for the `admin_password` in the `vm_base` and `cockroachdb` modules. This is a security risk as it exposes sensitive information.\n",
      "   - **Improper Access Controls:** The security rules in the `nsg` module allow all inbound traffic (`source_address_prefix = \"*\"`) which is not secure. Specific IP ranges should be defined to limit access.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration:**\n",
      "   - **Network Security Group Rules:** The generated code includes an unnecessary RDP rule (`destination_port_range = \"3389\"`) which is not required for Ubuntu VMs.\n",
      "   - **CockroachDB Configuration:** The `cockroachdb` module does not include specific configurations for running CockroachDB, such as setting up data directories, configuring ports, or initializing the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors:**\n",
      "   - **Resource Dependencies:** The generated code does not clearly define dependencies between resources. For example, the `cockroachdb` module should depend on the `vm_base` module to ensure that the VMs are created before setting up CockroachDB.\n",
      "   - **Subnet Configuration:** The `vnet` module creates two subnets, but the generated code does not specify which subnet the VMs should be placed in.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues:**\n",
      "   - **Dynamic Resource Names:** The use of dynamic resource names (e.g., `os_disk_name = \"os-disk-${count.index}\"`) can lead to inconsistencies when the code is applied multiple times. Resource names should be consistent to ensure idempotency.\n",

      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues:**\n",
      "   - **None detected.**\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules:**\n",
      "   - **Module Inputs and Outputs:** The generated code does not clearly define the input and output variables for each module. This can lead to confusion and errors when passing information between modules.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues:**\n",
      "   - **Subnet Assignment:** The generated code does not specify which subnet the VMs should be placed in, leading to potential network isolation issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency:**\n",
      "    - **Resource Allocation:** The generated code uses the `Standard_B2ms` VM size, which may not be sufficient for running CockroachDB and its load generators. The VM size should be chosen based on the performance requirements.\n",

      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The generated Terraform code does not fully meet the user’s requirements and has several issues related to security, resource configuration, logical errors, and networking configuration.

      "\n",
      "4. **Best Practices**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the `logging_service` and `monitoring_service` attributes to `\"none\"`, which is a best practice to meet the user's requirement of having no default logging or monitoring services.\n",

      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the required Terraform and provider versions, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",

      "**Reason:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not explicitly handle sensitive data securely. For example, the service account key is generated but not stored securely or marked as sensitive in the outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration:**\n",
      "   - The `google_project` resource in the generated code is incorrectly configured. The `google_project` resource does not have a `service_account` block. Instead, service accounts should be created using the `google_service_account` resource.\n",

      "   - The generated code does not assign the specified roles and permissions to the service account.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure idempotency for the project creation and service account provisioning. The use of `random_project_id` in the Golden Terraform code ensures unique project IDs, which is missing in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors:**\n",
      "   - There are no syntax errors in the generated code, but the logical and functional issues make it incorrect.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not handle resource deletion or replacement correctly. The Golden Terraform code uses modules to manage resources, ensuring that changes are applied correctly without unintended deletions.\n",

      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not use modules correctly. The Golden Terraform code uses the `terraform-google-modules/project-factory/google` module to create the project, which is a best practice for modular and maintainable infrastructure.\n",

      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the correct dataset and table configurations as required by the user query. The user query specifies multiple datasets and tables for various census reports across multiple years and regions, but the generated code only provides a single dataset and table configuration.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify static IPs for the instances, which is a key requirement from the user query.\n",

      "In summary, the generated Terraform code is incomplete and does not meet the user’s requirements as described in the query. It lacks critical configurations, does not use remote state data, and does not ensure proper tagging and lifecycle management.\n",
      "**Correct: No**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reason:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not explicitly mention any security configurations for the storage account, such as enabling secure transfer or setting up network rules. This could expose the storage account to security risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include specific configurations for the storage account, such as replication type (`RAGRS`), which is specified in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "   - The CDN profile module does not include configurations for HTTP/HTTPS settings or optimization type, which are specified in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not handle multiple environments (`dev` and `test`) as specified in the user query and Golden Terraform code. It only seems to handle a single environment.\n",
      "   - The `origin_host_header` in the CDN profile module is hardcoded to \"example.com\", which is not dynamically derived from the storage account as in the Golden Terraform code.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure idempotency for multiple environments. The use of modules without proper iteration over environments could lead to inconsistent results when applied multiple times.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors:**\n",
      "   - No syntax errors were found in the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not seem to handle resource deletion or replacement explicitly, but the lack of environment handling could lead to unintended resource changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the required provider version, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules:**\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules but does not provide sufficient details on how these modules are defined. This could lead to issues if the modules are not correctly implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues:**\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include any networking configurations for the storage account or CDN profile, which could lead to network isolation or exposure to threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency:**\n",
      "    - The generated code does not optimize resource usage for multiple environments, which could lead to increased costs or poor performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The generated Terraform code does not meet the user’s requirements as described in the query and does not align with the Golden Terraform code. It lacks proper handling of multiple environments, specific configurations for storage accounts and CDN profiles, and security considerations. Therefore, it is not correct.\n",
      "Correct: No\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason:\n",
      "1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:\n",
      "   - The security group allows ingress from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0) on port 80, which is a potential security risk. This should be restricted to specific IP ranges or security groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Resource Configuration**:\n",
      "   - The user query specifies the need for both master and node instances, but the generated code only includes configurations for web instances.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include IAM roles for both master and node instances as specified in the user query.\n",
      "   - The generated code does not include autoscaling groups for both master and node instances as specified in the user query.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logical Errors**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not output the required IDs and ARNs for the VPC, subnets, security groups, IAM roles, and autoscaling groups for both master and node instances.\n",
      "   - The `aws_launch_configuration` resource is defined twice, which is redundant and could lead to conflicts.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Idempotency Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not ensure idempotency for all resources. For example, the `aws_launch_configuration` resource should have a unique name prefix to avoid conflicts during multiple applies.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Syntax Errors**:\n",
      "   - The provided code snippet is incomplete and contains syntax errors, such as an unfinished `module \"instance_profile\"` block.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Resource Deletion or Replacement**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not handle potential resource deletions or replacements gracefully. For example, the `aws_autoscaling_group` resource should have lifecycle rules to prevent unintended deletions.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not specify the required Terraform or provider versions, which could lead to compatibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Misuse of Modules**:\n",
      "   - The generated code uses modules but does not provide complete and correct input variables for these modules. For example, the `subnets` module is referenced but not correctly defined.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Networking Configuration Issues**:\n",
      "   - The generated code does not fully configure the networking components as specified in the user query. It lacks the necessary subnets, route tables, and other networking configurations.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Performance and Efficiency**:\n",
      "    - The generated code does not optimize resource usage. For example, the autoscaling group configuration could be more efficient by using appropriate instance types and scaling policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the generated Terraform code does not meet the user’s requirements and contains several issues related to security, resource configuration, logical errors, and completeness. It needs significant modifications to align with the user query and follow best practices.\n"
