LLM-IaC: Infrastructure as Code using LLMs
LLM-IaC is a repository to hold the code, data prompts, and results for generating Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using a variety of Large Language Models (LLMs)—including open-source, closed-source, and code-generation-specific models. The IaC outputs were created by feeding 460 top-level user queries to the LLMs using various prompting strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned.
